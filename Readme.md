# Latin Grammar Project
## Part 1
This project aims to convert William Whitaker's Words into a database. The raw file uses each line to give an overview of a word, but this is difficult to use for translation. Some words in Latin can have over 10,000 forms, and although many of these forms are similar or identical to one another in many cases, it is useful for translation programs to have access to the full list. The database aims to do this by giving each word a UID and giving each form an entry in the database.
